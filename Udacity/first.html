<!-- Need to understand more about the 
  1. Density Pixel Ratio.  
  2. Hardware pixels
  3. Density Index Pixels

Hint: we know that we have 1920 hardware pixels across, and the device pixel ratio of 2 tells us that for every 1 CSS pixel, there are two hardware pixels.

With a device pixel ratio of 1 and a browser width of 800 pixels, you'll get a viewport width of 800 pixels.
Even if the whole screen is larger than the browser, the viewport is only about the browser's width (not the whole screen) -- so it's still just 800 pixels.

How wide is the viewport?
Calculating Viewport Width

Calculate the width (in dips) of the viewport for all of the devices below. Entering in just the number is fine!
A phone that is 640px wide, DPR = 2
320

A phablet that is 780px wide, DPR = 2.5
312

A tablet that is 1024px wide, DPR = 1
1024

A laptop browser that is 800px wide, DPR = 1
800
